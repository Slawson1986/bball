todo: regress a player into 'talent' and 'performance against defense'

so regress

player's FP
vs
opponent's FP given up for that position



regress team's defense against types of points vs player's percentage of shots
ie shots at rim/three pointers given up/etc



check pace

check team's off_rating def_rating



TODO: 
1) download all advanced boxscores
2) regress opponent's def_rating with player's points. see if there's correlation
