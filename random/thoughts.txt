Thanks for responding. I know you can't just give up your model, and I definitely don't want that. Just trying to make sure I understand what I'm looking at. Is the general thought process something like what follows?

So let's you expect LeBron to score 1.65 fantasy points per possession on average.

The game's O/U is approximately 203 which happens to be equal to the combined Off Efficiency of New Orleans (100.8) and Cleveland (102.1). In that case, we would expect a normal amount of possessions. So for the Cavs that will be 93.3. LeBron's USG% is 28.9% this year, so he will use approximately 27 possessions. So you project him to score 27*1.65 = 44.55 fantasy points.

Now, his fantasy points per possession has some standard deviation, and given that standard deviation you can calculate how often he will score 20 fantasy points, 30 points, 50 points, 60 points, etc. And then based on his dollar cost you can figure out how often he will reach a certain value.

Sorry, this is super long winded... I'm just feeling overwhelmed by all the analysis going into constructing these teams, and I want to make sure I have an idea of what's going on.

You basically laid that out perfectly. I make tweaks to the usage rate, because that doesn't capture everything that people are doing in the fantasy sense, but everything you said is the path I take. Good work!



I have projections based on the past 3 years of stats. I also grabbed projections from Fantasy Pros at the beginning of the season that carry a little bit of weight. It's basically just like you said, dividing his previous games by possessions, only I'm doing it for the past 3 years and weighing the results based on recency.

brandon's thoughts


This doesn't seem to take into account usage%; why don't you use the following procedure?

Fantasy points per possession * (usg% * pace) = predicted FP

where (usg% * pace) = number of possessions a player will actually use.

If you try to use that metric, how does that reconcile with your estimate of Dirk at 0.55 FPPP? Then, he might be projected to have:
0.55 FPPP * (26.6% * 92.2) = 13.48 FP, which is clearly way too low.

It seems like in calculating your FPP number, you're doing something like:

Fantasy points scored / (pace * (minutes played / 48)) over historical data

Why use that formula instead of

Fantasy points scored / (usage rate * pace of team)?

(9:22:25 AM) Alex Wang: i was thinking about is like
(9:22:43 AM) Alex Wang: vegas O/U projections
(9:22:44 AM) Alex Wang: use
(9:22:46 AM) Alex Wang: pace
(9:22:52 AM) Alex Wang: but what else do they use
(9:23:05 AM) Alex Wang: defense rtg?
(9:23:10 AM) Alex Wang: like how ot quantify
(9:23:17 AM) Alex Wang: that
(9:23:22 AM) Alex Wang: okay what im trying to say is like
(9:23:26 AM) Alex Wang: we basically wanted to
(9:23:42 AM) Alex Wang: integrate the "O/U" effect
(9:23:52 AM) Alex Wang: so to do that we broke it down to posessions and the minutes model like we have
(9:23:54 AM) Alex Wang: but to further that
(9:24:00 AM) Alex Wang: we would have to take into account a team's defense right?
(9:25:50 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: hm
(9:25:52 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: that sould be included
(9:25:53 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: cus in the OU
(9:25:56 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: vegas also has
(9:25:57 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: like
(9:26:00 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: how many points it exepcs
(9:26:03 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: expects each team to score
(9:26:09 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: so from that wecan decompose to pace of each team
(9:26:12 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: ?
(9:26:19 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: ie if vegas expects lakers-mem
(9:26:20 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: to be like
(9:26:24 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: lakers 95 -mem 105
(9:26:29 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: then memphis will have higher "pace"
(9:26:30 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: for the game
(9:26:35 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: i mean technically theyll have th esame number of possessions but
(9:26:41 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: b/c theyre expected to have more points 
(9:26:57 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: the "pace" for memphis players will be higher?
(9:27:02 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: and that will help take into acc the lakers shitty d
(9:27:03 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: for example
(9:27:36 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: wait how do we go from points (O/U) to possessions again?
(9:27:52 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: uhh was that using offensive efficiency?
(9:27:53 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: ohhhh ok
(9:28:00 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: so we can use OFF/DEF ratings
(9:28:07 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: which is pts scored/allowed per 100 possessions
(9:28:12 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: to scale vegas O/U's to possessions
(9:28:23 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: which will be pace
(9:28:29 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: that incorporates the off/def
(9:28:31 AM) simpavid@gmail.com/3F4A89B8: of a matchup
(9:28:49 AM) Alex Wang: yeah
